            "ingredients": ["10-12 oz water (~100-110°F)", "1 tsp kosher salt", "10 oz (weigh) pre-cooked white corn flour or masarepa", "1 oz unsalted butter, soft + more for cooking (if browning too much, use olive oil)", "2 ½ oz low moisture mozzarella, shredded", "Optional: 8-16slices deli-sliced mozzarella cheese"],
            "rawIngredients": ["water", "salt", "masarepa", "unsalted butter", "low moisture mozarella"],
            "instructions": ["In a large bowl, combine 12 ounces of water and salt.", "Slowly add the cornflour, in 4-5 additions, to the water mixture. Using your hands, begin mixing and kneading the dough until all of the cornflour is incorporated. Let the mixture sit for 3 minutes.", "Once the dough has rested, add the butter and cheese. Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes or until completely smooth and homogeneous. **try hand flattening one to check for proper moisture** If the dough is too dry, add another 1-2 ounces of water, or enough to form a supple but not sticky dough.", "Using wet hands, divide the dough into 8 relatively even balls. Press the balls into patties about ½ inch thick and 3-4 inches in diameter.", "Preheat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Brush the pan with more softened butter, then add the arepas.", "Cook on each side for 5-7 minutes, or until browned on both sides and cooked through. The arepas should be fluffy but not wet when cut into.", "Optionally, allow the arepas to cool for 2-3 minutes, or until handleable. Then, slice an opening on one side of each arepa, making sure not to cut through to the other side. Place a folded 1-2 slices of mozzarella cheese in the opened pocket of each arepa. Return the arepas to the same pan and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the cheese has melted."],
